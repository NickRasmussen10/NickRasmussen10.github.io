          <a href="https://nick-rasmussen.itch.io/school-is-canceled">School is Cancelled</a> is a 2D platformer I created for the Ludum Dare game jam. 
          The goal of this project was to get hands-on experience with Unity's animation systems, which I accomplished by adding animated feedback to as many in-game elements as possible. 
          The game features real-world whiteboard drawings brought to life using Photoshop and Unity.
