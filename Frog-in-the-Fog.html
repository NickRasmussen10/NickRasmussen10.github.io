          <a href="https://people.rit.edu/nlr3026/529/FrogInTheFog.html">Frog in the Fog</a> is an adventure game created for my Creative Writing Immersion at the Rochester Institute of Technology. 
          The game features an open space to explore implemented using Javascript and the HTML canvas feature. <br><br>
          The assignment required the use of the Twine text adventure game engine, which lacked native support for the mechanics I wanted to implement. 
          Because of this requirement, I had to develop custom mechanics beyond what Twine is normally capable of producing. 
          Doing so led to technical lessons which would prove instrumental in developing <a href="Town-Called-Trouble.html">A Town Called Trouble</a>, the game's sequel.
